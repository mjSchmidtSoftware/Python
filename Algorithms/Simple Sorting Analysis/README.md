Bubble sort was found to be the slowest of the simple sorting algorthems. Selection sort  
and insertion sort where both improvements on bubble but in terms of each other, the execution   
time was roughly the same. Depending on how already sorted the array is, Insertion Sort can be  
qucker then then selection Sort when sorting a partially sorted array. 
  
Bubble Sort O(n^2)  
Selection Sort O(n^2)  
Insertion Sort O(n^2)

Bubble sort is simple but slow, bubble sort is so slow because it's swapping every time  
it finds an adjacent element out of order.  
  
Worst-case performance 	O(n^2)  
Best-case performance 	O(n^2)  
Average performance 	O(n^2)

The selection sort is an improvement on bubble sort by making only one exchange for every   
pass through the array.  
  
Worst-case performance 	O(n^2)  
Best-case performance 	O(n^2)  
Average performance 	O(n^2)

Insertion sort is an improvement on bubble and selection, Instead of swapping the algorthem  
slide/shift the array until an insert position is found.  
  
Best-case performance 	O(n)  
Average performance 	O(n^2)   
Worst-case performance 	O(n^2)
